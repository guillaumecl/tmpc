** TODO Add a way to wait for events
Basically we can send mpd_send_idle_mask and then poll the fd for data (using mpd_connection_get_fd)
Once we got data we can run mpd_recv_idle.

For this, we can add these methods in the mpd class:
  - start_idle  : starts an idle wait
  - stop_idle   : stops the current idle wait
  - idle_events : iterator to a list of events that occurred.

That will allow to keep using only one thread. We can also use mpd_run_idle or friends to poll in another thread.
** TODO Add playlist-oriented facilities
* Search mode
** TODO Add a mode to select and visualize playlists
Playlists and queues are similar. The search window probably can run mostly unmodified for playlist requests. 
** TODO Allow to save playlists and modify playlists
We just need a way to save the result window to a playlist.
** TODO Allow to see in a db search if the songs are inside the current playlist
* Display mode
** TODO Wait for events and show the next song if needed.
